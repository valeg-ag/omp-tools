Dev installation:

1. Install dependencies.
```
> npm install
```

2. Rebuild oracledb against the current installed Electron version. Correct electron version is version from VSCode.

You need to install Python 2.7 if you don't have one.

```
> npm install -g nan
> npm root -g
C:\Users\AvsOmega\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
> set NODE_PATH=C:\Users\AvsOmega\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules

> .\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd --version=2.0.12 --arch=x64
âˆš Rebuild Complete
```

If we get some msbuild errors, first of all ensure that  msbuild does not exist in PATH folders. You can check it with command:

```
> where msbuild
INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).
```
3. Create vsix-package:

You need to install `vsce` if you don't have one.
```
npm install -g vsce
```

```
> vsce package
Created: D:\projects\ompext4\ompext-0.0.1.vsix (3114 files, 12.82MB)
```
